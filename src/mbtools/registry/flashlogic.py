"""registry.flashlogic — pyOCD flash with transient retry and mass-erase recovery.

Per sprint 003's Architecture (Decision 4 / Step 3's module table), this is
the shared flash-with-recovery implementation moved here from
``mbtools.deploy.flash`` (itself ported near-verbatim from ``mbdeploy``'s
own ``src/mbdeploy/flash.py`` in sprint 002 -- see that sprint's ticket
005): the one place pyOCD's failure wording is matched against known
signatures, unchanged in shape from the existing, hardware-proven
implementation. ``docs/acceptance/001-hardware.md``'s hodr/braeburn
transient-probe-timeout retries and braeburn's ``0x67`` mass-erase-recovery
finding are exactly what this module handles.

This module takes no lock itself and knows nothing about the registry --
it flashes whatever UID it's given, streaming log lines to its caller. It
is called from two places: locally, by ``deploy.cli`` via the
``mbtools.deploy.flash`` re-export shim (unchanged since sprint 002); and
remotely, by ``registry.remote_api`` (ticket 009 in this sprint), which
invokes it directly after taking a ``flash``-kind lock over the wire.
Both callers get the exact same recovery behavior because both call this
one implementation -- this move changes only where the code lives, not
what it does.

Unlike ``mbtools.registry.flash`` (sprint 001's deliberately minimal
registry op -- one pyOCD invocation, no retry, no recovery, per that
module's own docstring), this module carries the "fancy work": a blind
retry on a transient-looking probe/communication failure, a CTRL-AP
mass erase (with one retry) on a locked/protected-device signature, and
an explicit, unmissable "no firmware" report when a post-erase reflash
still fails. ``DEFAULT_MCU`` is imported from ``mbtools.registry.flash``
rather than redefined here -- see that module's own docstring for why
the nRF52833 constant lives there.

# erase destroys a working board's firmware, a missed recovery only costs

    """Flash ``hex_path`` to the board behind ``uid``, with mass-erase recovery.

    A failed first flash whose output looks transient triggers one blind
    retry; a failure that persists (or never looked transient) triggers a
    CTRL-AP mass erase and one retry only if its output looks *locked*;
    any other failure returns without ever mass-erasing. A mass-erase
    failure returns its own return code without retrying the flash. A
    still-failing flash after a successful mass erase returns its return
    code, with an explicit "no firmware" report. Success returns the
    ``reset`` return code.

    Each pyocd subprocess's output is streamed through ``log`` as it
    arrives (see :func:`_run_streamed`) rather than captured and
    discarded, so a caller-supplied ``log`` sees progress throughout
    each invocation, not just at the fixed transition messages below.

    Before any of that: ``hex_path`` is validated with ``intelhex``
    (:func:`_validate_hex`). A missing, unreadable, or malformed hex file
    fails here, with a clear message routed through ``log``, before any
    ``pyocd`` subprocess is constructed or run -- so an operator-side file
    problem never reaches the board at all.

    A first flash failure whose output looks transient (a probe timeout,
    a communication/transfer fault, or a ``DAPAccess`` error --
    :func:`_looks_transient`) is retried exactly once, logged visibly,
    before anything else is decided -- most flaky-USB failures simply
    succeed the second time with no change to the board's state at all.

    A failure that persists past that (or that never looked transient in
    the first place) is mass-erased and retried only if its output looks
    *locked* (:func:`_looks_locked`) -- a `0x67` sector-erase failure, or
    auth/lock/APPROTECT wording. Any other failure (an invalid hex that
    slipped past validation, a bad ``target_mcu``, or anything else this
    module doesn't recognize) fails immediately **without** erasing:
    an unrecognized signature is deliberately never treated as "assume
    locked," because an unnecessary mass erase destroys a working
    board's firmware while a missed recovery only costs the operator one
    manual ``pyocd erase --mass``.

    If the mass erase itself succeeds but the retried flash still fails,
    the board has no firmware at all -- the erase already wiped it and
    reflashing didn't take. That is reported explicitly and unmissably
    through ``log`` (not only local stderr), naming the board via
    ``board_name`` (falling back to ``uid`` when not given).
